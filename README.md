<strong>Film-Fiesta App Build Instructions</strong>

<strong>Overview</strong><br>
We are using build tools to set up and build Film-Fiesta, a movie app.
Specifically, We will be organizing the Film-Fiesta-client directory with the required files and we will be using Parcel to complete the
necessary build operations for this project.

<strong>Getting Started</strong><br>
To get started with building the Film-Fiesta app, these are the steps:<br>

1. Set up the Film-Fiesta-client directory.
2. Ensure we have Node.js and npm installed on our system.
3. Install Parcel as our build tool.
4. Organize our project structure as described above.
5. Begin coding our app logic and styling within the respective source code files.
   <br><br>

<strong>Building the App</strong><br>
Once the project is set up and our code is in place, we can use Parcel to build the Film-Fiesta app. Parcel will bundle our source code files and assets into a distributable format, making it ready for deployment.
To build our app using Parcel, run the appropriate build command defined in your package.json file.
